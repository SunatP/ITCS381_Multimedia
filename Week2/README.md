## Representation of Monochrome Image in programming
  - ## Grey Channel
   ![1](https://www.spacetelescope.org/static/projects/img/imgproc_fig2.jpg)
  * each element (pixel) in Matrix (2D Array) represents the intensity of brightness in that pixel 
    * 0 is equal to Black (0-Black)
    * 255 is equal to White (255-White)
    *  **NOTE** **Monochrome:** Each pixel is stored as asingle bit (0 or 1) A 640 x 480 monochrome image requires 37.5 KB of storage.
    *  **Grayscale:** Each pixel is usually storedas a byte (value between 0
to 255)A 640 x 480 grayscale image requires over 300 KB of storage

  - ## RGB Channel

  * In the Red Channel, each element of the matrix (valued 0-255) represents an intensity of red color in that pixel, likewise in green and blue channels.
